  "body": "# Household Website\r\n\r\nThis is just a simple and easy-to-setup web App, \r\nthat allows you to manage multiple things within\r\na household. And it is also easy to customize to\r\nwhatever you like.\r\n\r\nThe code uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) as the website engine, \r\nand [Flat-Ui](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/) for the \r\nuser interface.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nFirst you need to have django. You can run a local\r\nversion with that.\r\nIf you want to make it accessible on internet.\r\nThere're few free options:\r\n\r\n1. [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)\r\n\r\n1. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)\r\n\r\nAnd that's basicly it.\r\n\r\n## Basic settings\r\n\r\n1. First you need to create a database. A SQLite is suffice,\r\nbut if you want MySQL please proceed with caution.\r\n\r\n1. Find settings.py.local and settings.py.production\r\nin ./mysite/mysite/ directory. Make a copy of settings.py.local\r\nto settings.py and fill in the DATABASE settings.\r\n\r\n1. Then create a superuser for the web App with\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    ./manage.py createsuperuser\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Do the migrations for Django with\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    ./manage.py makemigrations\r\n    ./manage.py migrate\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Then you should be able to run the website locally with\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    ./manage.py runserver\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## User settings\r\n\r\nWhen you are able to run the website locally, \r\nthen you should be able to put it online as well.\r\n\r\nAfter that you need to configure users as the website is \r\nmajorly protected by user authorization.\r\n\r\nCurrently the code will load all the users and data in the \r\n```home_members``` group.\r\nJust put everyone in that group and it's good to go.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Shared purchases and balance for members\r\n\r\n* Payment recording\r\n\r\n## Features will come in the future\r\n\r\n* Support for multiple home groups.\r\n\r\n* Email notification and broadcast support for superuser",
