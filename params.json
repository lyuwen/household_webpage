You can run a local\r\nversion with that.\r\nIf you want to make it accessible on internet.\r\nThere're few free options:\r\n\r\n1. [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)\r\n\r\n1. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)\r\n\r\nAnd that's basicly it.\r\n\r\n## Basic settings\r\n\r\n1. First you need to create a database. A SQLite is suffice,\r\nbut if you want MySQL please proceed with caution.\r\n\r\n1. Find settings.py.local and settings.py.production\r\nin ./mysite/mysite/ directory. Make a copy of settings.py.local\r\nto settings.py and fill in the DATABASE settings.\r\n\r\n1. Then create a superuser for the web App with\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    ./manage.py createsuperuser\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Do the migrations for Django with\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    ./manage.py makemigrations\r\n    ./manage.py migrate\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Then you should be able to run the website locally with\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    ./manage.py runserver\r\n    ```\r\n",
